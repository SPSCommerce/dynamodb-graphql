# dynamodb-graphql

Simple DynamoDB backed GraphQL framework

Provides a simple API for creating nodes in a graph within dynamodb tables. Many helper functions to assist in creating resolvers for objects and linked objects.


## Installation

npm install @bluelines/dynamodb-graphql --save
```


## Basic usage

## Future Goals

Long term the goal is to use directives in the schemas to inform this framework how entities are stored and referenced. Then you'd only need define the schema with some directives and the framework took care of resolvers for you.
